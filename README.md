# MLH-Hackathon
Imagine the parking lot at the airport - and having a flight in 30 mins. Not fun, right? Well, don't fear, EzPark's here

## Inspiration
Frustrating experience at the parking lot when going out of town and in a hurry. 

## What it does
Given a parking lot size and spaces occupied (as txt input), it tries to simulate real-world traffic experience to output open spaces in the lot. 

## How I built it
Backend was built using python and efficient data structures like sets and dictionaries while front-end was built using classic yet golden HTML5/CSS3. 

## Challenges I ran into
- Team members not having enough technical experience and/or leaving in the middle. Was a little challenging to work on it just by myself :D 
- Front-end development using just HTML/CSS without much experince; I'm used to working with frameworks like Angular and Flask. 
- Parallel programming in python and sharing memory between two modules. 

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
- Designing and developing a parking space calculator and traffic simulator by myself 
- Learning to execute programs in parallel
- Sharing memory across different modules 
- Timing execution of multiple programs to minimize interference 

## What We learned
- Creating and writing to files 
- The {Set} data structure (in Python) 

## What's next for Ez-Park - Parking Lot Aide
- Much better and interactive front-end 
- Mobile app for parking lot owners/managers and users (real-life parking lots and users)
